# Build Order Tool for Age of Empires IV

This Build Order Tool will allow users to view, create, and share build orders standard format via the web app.
The web app can be found on: https://age4builder.web.app/

## Goals of the Build Order Tool

This tool started mainly as a coding challenge and to learn some Javascript along the way.
Now I've identified the following goals for this tool to fulfill:

1. Viewing builds
   - Tool must work on both computers and mobile devices
   - Must be quick and responsive for mobile devices
   - Images and text must be easy to be read at glance
   - (FUTURE) Make builds "play" in Real-time with voice-over

2. Creating builds
   - Creating builds must work on computers (because one requires a computer for AoE 4)
   - A 'standardized' format must be given to allow for creators to use a similar format, this will help with readability of each build
   - Icons can be dragged into the build and together with text make up the final build
   - Standard formatting tools for tables
   - (FUTURE) Make it possible to edit builds on mobile devices
   - (FUTURE) Add in game-specifics like Map-type or oppossing Civilizations 

3. Sharing builds
   - Share created builds with other via custom URLs
   - (FUTURE) Allow users to browse popular builds

## Why Github?

As per request I figured out how to put the project on Github. 
I will use this to track issues for myself and allow others to help building this tool into something amazing!
